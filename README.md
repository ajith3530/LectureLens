# LectureLens
LectureLens is openai based tool which is a lifeline for the constantly dangling working professional, managing the intricate balance between their career, personal and academic commitments. This tool emerged from my personal challenges encountered throughout the WILP program.

Massive help to all categories of students.
Category 1: Who attend all classes, this summarization would serve as a revision material.
Category 2: Who couldn’t attend a class due to professional or personal reasons, could see the insights from FAQ and make a decision on reviewing the course material.
Category 3: Who don’t attend any classes, for them this can be an extension of the lecture PPT to know exactly what the teacher taught instead of the PPT material. Lecture Lens helps in generating interest for this category of students to actually watch the recording and enhance their learnings.

BITS Admins will be able to review the course content video which can span upto 30 hours per course in just a matter of an hour to see if the topics being taught are inline with the curriculum requirements.
